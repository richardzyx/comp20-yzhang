====================================
All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented independently.

I have spent about 1.5 h on this assignment because I did not fully understand the difference between JQuery and JS, so I spent some time reading and researching. The .html and .val also got me confused for a while.

Minor problem: when I run the website on my browser after I did a localStorage clear, other than the words I typed in, I get a list of empty strings with just the time stamp and without content, and the order of the time is still correct. I believe it's because of the way I cleaned up.
