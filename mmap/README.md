This is the Assi 2 MMAP for Comp20
====================================
All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. I have not collaborated nor discussed the assignment with anyone.

I have spent approx. 10 hours on this assignment. Some of the major problems: info windows for different character were the same; didn't realize getting icon mean downloading from the assignment page; getting legend, the distance display, to work.

The main concept for this program is to use a sortable array of distances in miles, and store the distance as key and its name into an object. It saves the time and effort to manually sort, and is quick in finding the name.

The legend implementation if from the Google Map APIs custom control page.
