<h1>Security Assessment Assignment 4 for Comp20</h1>

<p>Prepared by <a href="http://richardzyx.github.io/">Richard Yuxuan Zhang</a> &bull; 12/4/2014</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This assessment tests the security of the <a href="https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/">Checkins Server</a> web application developed by <a href="http://ybenhayun.github.io/">@Yuval</a>. This web application is a server for accepting client's geo-locations as check-in information, providing past one hundred history check-in records, and also connecting to the MBTA's redline API. My responsibility is to find vulnerability and exploitable loopholes in this server, and give credible assessment for each finding.</p>

<h2>Methdology</h2>

<p>Testing was first carried out in "black-box" setting, with common vulnerability checks and attacks. And then I looked at Yuval's source code and made further suggestions on the possible security loopholes. The code and server was run on heroku and not run on my local computer.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Finding</h2>

<p>I will come back to this point later</p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>MongoDB Find Search</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: Through MongoDB's find function's vulnerability to include <code>[$ne]</code> for search inquiry, one can easily access to the records of all login users.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: /locations.json?
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: High, considering the fact that the attacker can now access to all records that is not encypted at the first place.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: Through in class discussion on MongoDB vulnerability, and this is a rather common one for all server using MongoDB.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability:<p>
			<img src="MongoDB.png" alt="MongoDB loophole proof" />
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: Gabe Joseph's solution is perfect: the mongo query should be build explicitly, not taken entirely from user input!
		<pre><code>if (request.query.username) {
collection.find( { 'username' : sanitize(request.query.username) });
//Use data...
}
</code></pre>
	</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: POST API of the server allows for Javascript insertion, which can be manipulated to a direction to third party websites.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: /sendLocation
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: High, since this vulnerability has the ability to make the disable normal visiting to the website.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: Through in class iscussion on user input, and this is a typical result if you don't check for user input. A simple curl could do the trick: <code>"curl --data "login=<$script$ type="text/javascript">window.location.href='http://www.google.com'</$script$>" https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/sendLocationclear"</code>. I put extra $ sign in case of redirection on this page.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability:Since the index page is now being redirected to Google, I will post a screenshot on the success injection of the script:
		<P>
			<img src="XSS.png" alt="XSS Proof">
		</P>
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: A check for user input is highly recommended with a minimal cost in fixing the code. One can also introduce JQuery validator like <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation">this</a> one.
	</li>
	<li>
		Extra notice: While injecting the code, I also found that for the "href" part of the code, if one leave out "http://" the website will be directed to a branch page such as 
		<p>
			<code>https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/www.google.com</code>. This could be a serious problem is the attack aims to a news/shopping site.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Validation on Input</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: The server did not check if login, lat, and lng are all defined. It is also a really bad practice.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: sendLocation
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: Medium, while the attack could use minumum data to create overwhelming data to shut down the server.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: While tackling XSS vulnerability, see Problem 2's picture.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability: The photo in Problem 2 can be seen as a proof.
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: The code for validation should be like this:
		<p>
			<pre><code>
if (login == undefined || lat == undefined || lng == undefined) {
	response.send(500);
}
else {
	lat=parseFloat(lat);
	lng=parseFloat(lng);
	var toInsert = {
		"login": login,
		"lat": lat,
		"lng": lng,
		"created_at": (new Date()).toJSON(),
};
			</code></pre>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Problem 4</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue:
	</li>
	<li>
		Location:
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue:
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding:
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability:
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution:
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>
