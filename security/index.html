<h1>Security Assessment Assignment 4 for COMP20</h1>

<p>Prepared by <a href="http://richardzyx.github.io/">Richard Yuxuan Zhang</a> &bull; 12/4/2014</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This assessment tests the security of the <a href="https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/">Checkins Server</a> web application developed by <a href="http://ybenhayun.github.io/">@Yuval</a>. This web application is a server for accepting client's geo-locations as check-in information, providing past one hundred history check-in records, and also connecting to the MBTA's redline API. My responsibility is to find vulnerability and exploitable loopholes in this server, and give credible assessment for each finding.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Testing was first carried out in "black-box" setting, with common vulnerability checks and attacks. And then I looked at Yuval's source code and made further suggestions on the possible security loopholes. The code and server was run on Heroku and not run on my local computer.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Finding</h2>

<p>Overall, the server is easily exposed to basic attacks including scripted, meaningless user input, leak of the entire database, redirection, and faked geo-location. The first problem can cause the leak of the entire server's database with a simple request to the server. The lack of user input caused the second and third problem, which can either overwhelm the server or redirect the server to any web page. The final problem is a potential threat if one wants to expand the server's function to geo-location based social networking, since it is very hard to fix this vulnerability.</p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>MongoDB Find Search</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: Through MongoDB's find function's vulnerability to include <code>[$ne]</code> for search inquiry, one can easily access to the records of all login users.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: /locations.json?
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: High, considering the fact that the attacker can now access to all records that is not encrypted at the first place.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: Through in class discussion on MongoDB vulnerability, and this is a rather common one for all server using MongoDB.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability:<p>
			<img src="MongoDB.png" alt="MongoDB loophole proof" />
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: Gabe Joseph's solution is perfect: the Mongo query should be build explicitly, not taken entirely from user input!
		<pre><code>if (request.query.username) {
collection.find( { 'username' : sanitize(request.query.username) });
//Use data...
}
</code></pre>
	</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: POST API of the server allows for Javascript insertion, which can be manipulated to a direction to third party websites.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: /sendLocation
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: High, since this vulnerability has the ability to make the disable normal visiting to the website.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: Through in class discussion on user input, and this is a typical result if you don't check for user input. A simple curl could do the trick: <code>"curl --data "login=<$script$ type="text/javascript">window.location.href='http://www.google.com'</$script$>" https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/sendLocationclear"</code>. I put extra $ sign in case of redirection on this page.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability:Since the index page is now being redirected to Google, I will post a screen shot on the success injection of the script:
		<P>
			<img src="XSS.png" alt="XSS Proof">
		</P>
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: A check for user input is highly recommended with a minimal cost in fixing the code. One can also introduce JQuery validator like <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation">this</a> one.
	</li>
	<li>
		Extra notice: While injecting the code, I also found that for the "href" part of the code, if one leave out "http://" the website will be directed to a branch page such as 
		<p>
			<code>https://shielded-temple-1577.herokuapp.com/www.google.com</code>. This could be a serious problem is the attack aims to a news/shopping site.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Validation on Input</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: The server did not check if login, lat, and lng are all defined. It is also a really bad practice.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: sendLocation
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: Medium, while the attack could use minimum data to create overwhelming data to shut down the server.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: While tackling XSS vulnerability, see Problem 2's picture.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability: The photo in Problem 2 can be seen as a proof.
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: The code for validation should be like this:
		<p>
			<pre><code>
if (login == undefined || lat == undefined || lng == undefined) {
	response.send(500);
}
else {
	lat=parseFloat(lat);
	lng=parseFloat(lng);
	var toInsert = {
		"login": login,
		"lat": lat,
		"lng": lng,
		"created_at": (new Date()).toJSON(),
};
			</code></pre>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Accepted Fake Geo-location</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Issue: The server cannot tell if the geo-location is faked.
	</li>
	<li>
		Location: Through assignment two accessible <a href="http://ybenhayun.github.io/geoIndex.html">Here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Severity of issue: High, considering the app as a geo-location based interaction social network tool, the faking of geo-location could be devastating.
	</li>
	<li>
		Method of Finding: When I was using Chrome Development Tool, I found this possibility to fake geo-location with chrome's built-in function. See the picture attached as proof of vulnerability.
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof of Vulnerability: Using the Chrome Development Tool, one can fake geo-location very easily.
		<p>
			<img src="geo.png" alt="Proof of fake geo-location">
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolution: Protecting the server from fake geo-location can be a difficult task as being discussed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3319414/any-way-to-verify-users-geolocation">here</a>. In short there is no perfect solution, and the most possible solution is to verify client's IP address, which can then also be tempered.
	</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To conclude, the first step towards a safer server is to correctly add user input check. Further validation should be considered for queries and POST API as recommended. Meanwhile, the problem of fake geo-location is nearly impossible to be fixed, so one should not focus on finding the cure for this loophole.</p>
