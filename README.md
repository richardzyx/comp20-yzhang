This is the Lab 9 README for COMP 20
====================================
The purpose of this repository is to hold all of the homework and lab assignment for COMP20 in Fall 2014.

My favorite assignment is in fact the final semester group project, as it is the way to combine all of the practical knowledge into a new realm of technique- ruby on rails- and work with people from different backgrounds to accomplish the same goal. It has been a great ride.

I think I have grown a LOT from day 1, as I would not have fathom the possibility to understand the corporate the knowledge of Git, Sublime Text, heroku, node.js, MongoDB, Postgres, Rails, JS, and so one in one semester. More importantly, I now have the ability to actually put some thing on the web and make it accessible to every corner of the world.

There are a lot of important things I have learn, and the one on the top of my head is the use of API in homework 2 and final semester group project.

I would really love to delve deeper into the back-end development especially its communication with the front.
