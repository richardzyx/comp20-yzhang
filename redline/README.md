This is the Lab 5 MBTA Redline for Comp20
====================================
I have spent about two hours on this assignment about JSON and same origin politicy, and implemented mostly the same file as the example given by the instruction.

The big problem with fetching real time data from MBTA is that it has not allowed cross reference operation on its server, and JS defaultly does not allow fetch data from different server.
